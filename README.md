# DragDropResizeUpload
A simple drag / drop files uploader with a jQuery dependecy.

![Example](DragDrop.gif)

This is a light weight drag and drop form with client side resizing. The uploaded images are resized into squares within a hidden canvas.
The image is then extracted from the hidden canvas and can be easily uploaded to a server.

The images are resized by cropping the larger dimension (width or height) such that the image is centred.

This was developed many years ago due to the lack of simple and light weight drag / drop / resize plugins.
